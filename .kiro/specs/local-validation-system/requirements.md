# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive local validation system for the MAFT (Multimodal Attention Fusion Transformer) project. The system will verify that all components work correctly with dummy/synthetic datasets before deploying to cloud infrastructure for full-scale training. This validation system will test the complete pipeline from data loading through model training, ensuring confidence in the implementation before incurring cloud costs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Synthetic Data Generation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate realistic synthetic multimodal datasets locally, so that I can test the complete pipeline without downloading large real datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates synthetic data THEN it SHALL create text, audio, and visual features matching the expected dimensions (text: variable length with BERT tokenization, audio: 74-dim COVAREP features, visual: 35-dim FACET features)
2. WHEN synthetic data is created THEN it SHALL include both classification targets (binary sentiment) and regression targets (continuous scores in range [-3, 3])
3. WHEN generating synthetic batches THEN the system SHALL support configurable batch sizes, sequence lengths, and number of samples
4. WHEN creating synthetic data THEN it SHALL include proper attention masks for variable-length sequences
5. IF the user specifies correlations THEN the synthetic data SHALL generate multimodal features with controllable cross-modal correlations to simulate realistic scenarios

### Requirement 2: Component-Level Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test individual model components in isolation, so that I can identify which specific component is failing if issues arise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing encoders THEN the system SHALL verify that text (BERT), audio (BiLSTM), and visual (BiLSTM) encoders produce outputs of expected dimensions
2. WHEN testing the fusion module THEN it SHALL verify cross-modal attention mechanisms work correctly with all modality combinations
3. WHEN testing modality dropout THEN it SHALL verify that random modality dropping works during training and is disabled during evaluation
4. WHEN testing task heads THEN it SHALL verify both classification and regression heads produce valid outputs
5. WHEN testing loss computation THEN it SHALL verify all loss components (classification, regression, consistency, reconstruction) are computed correctly

### Requirement 3: End-to-End Pipeline Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run a complete training loop with synthetic data, so that I can verify the entire pipeline works before using real data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running end-to-end training THEN the system SHALL complete forward pass, loss computation, backward pass, and optimizer step without errors
2. WHEN training for multiple epochs THEN the system SHALL show decreasing loss values indicating the model is learning
3. WHEN running validation THEN the system SHALL compute metrics (accuracy, F1, MAE, Pearson correlation) on held-out synthetic data
4. WHEN training completes THEN the system SHALL save model checkpoints and training logs
5. IF memory issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with memory usage statistics

### Requirement 4: Configuration Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate that all configuration files are correct and compatible, so that I don't encounter configuration errors during cloud deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading configuration files THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields are present
2. WHEN validating model config THEN it SHALL check that dimensions are compatible (hidden_dim divisible by num_heads, etc.)
3. WHEN validating training config THEN it SHALL verify learning rates, batch sizes, and other hyperparameters are within reasonable ranges
4. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages indicating what needs to be fixed
5. WHEN configurations are valid THEN the system SHALL display a summary of all settings before starting tests

### Requirement 5: Resource Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage during local testing, so that I can estimate resource requirements for cloud deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests start THEN the system SHALL display current system resources (CPU cores, available memory, disk space)
2. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL monitor and log memory usage throughout execution
3. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL report peak memory usage and average CPU utilization
4. IF resources are insufficient THEN the system SHALL warn the user before starting resource-intensive operations
5. WHEN monitoring completes THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for cloud instance sizing based on observed resource usage

### Requirement 6: Baseline Comparison Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to compare MAFT against simple baselines on synthetic data, so that I can verify the model architecture provides benefits over simpler approaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running baseline tests THEN the system SHALL train simple models (text-only, late fusion, early fusion) on the same synthetic data
2. WHEN comparing models THEN it SHALL compute the same metrics for all models to enable fair comparison
3. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL display a comparison table showing relative performance
4. IF MAFT underperforms baselines THEN the system SHALL flag this as a potential issue requiring investigation
5. WHEN comparison is successful THEN the system SHALL save results to a structured format (JSON/CSV) for later reference

### Requirement 7: Data Loading and Preprocessing Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate data loading and preprocessing pipelines, so that I can ensure they work correctly before processing large real datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing data loaders THEN the system SHALL verify batches are created correctly with proper padding and masking
2. WHEN preprocessing data THEN it SHALL verify tokenization, feature normalization, and alignment are working correctly
3. WHEN using DataLoader THEN it SHALL test with different num_workers settings to verify multiprocessing works
4. IF data loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages indicating the failure point
5. WHEN data loading succeeds THEN the system SHALL report loading speed (samples/second) to estimate training time

### Requirement 8: Gradient Flow and Training Stability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify gradients flow correctly through all model components, so that I can ensure stable training before cloud deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking gradients THEN the system SHALL verify all trainable parameters receive gradients during backpropagation
2. WHEN monitoring gradient norms THEN it SHALL detect gradient explosion or vanishing gradient issues
3. WHEN testing gradient clipping THEN it SHALL verify the clipping mechanism works as configured
4. IF gradient issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide specific recommendations (adjust learning rate, check loss scaling, etc.)
5. WHEN gradients are healthy THEN the system SHALL report gradient statistics (mean, std, min, max) for key layers

### Requirement 9: Attention Mechanism Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify attention mechanisms work correctly, so that I can ensure the core fusion component is functioning properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extracting attention weights THEN the system SHALL verify they sum to 1.0 across the attention dimension
2. WHEN testing cross-modal attention THEN it SHALL verify all modality pairs (text-audio, text-visual, audio-visual) produce valid attention patterns
3. WHEN visualizing attention THEN the system SHALL generate sample attention heatmaps for inspection
4. IF attention patterns are degenerate (all uniform or all peaked) THEN the system SHALL flag this as a potential issue
5. WHEN attention is working THEN the system SHALL save sample attention visualizations for manual inspection

### Requirement 10: Comprehensive Test Report

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive test report summarizing all validation results, so that I can make an informed decision about proceeding to cloud deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate a detailed report with pass/fail status for each test
2. WHEN generating the report THEN it SHALL include timing information for each test component
3. WHEN tests pass THEN the report SHALL provide a clear "ready for cloud deployment" recommendation
4. IF any tests fail THEN the report SHALL provide specific troubleshooting steps and recommendations
5. WHEN the report is generated THEN it SHALL be saved in both human-readable (Markdown) and machine-readable (JSON) formats
